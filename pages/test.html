                        The Space65 R3 is a board that a few may call their endgame. The design of the board is fairly pretty. 
                        From the inseem created between the top and bottom pieces to subtly display the mid accent piece, to the 
                        thicker side bezzels and magnetic accent badge. These design elements culminate in the bespoke board that 
                        is the Space65.
                        <br>
                        <br> 
                        However my only gripe with this interation of the Space65 is the sound. The flex cuts in the pcb 
                        and the mounting style of the board leaves a lot to be desired in terms of my own sound preference. 
                        With all that being said, I wouldn't consider the Space65 R3 to be an endgame board, but it sure is pretty.

                        The Mode Sonnet (2022), a board I can confidently say is amazing. The Sonnet's amazing customizablility with the 
                        wide array of options offered by <a href="https://modedesigns.com/" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mode</a>, 
                        along with it's sleek side profile and the accent piece that spans the top bezel of the board just culminates in a board 
                        that anyone would be happy to have on their desk. In addition to its design, the Sonnet (2022) features a 75% layout, 
                        a pretty popular layout. The sonnet has likely been a significant catalyst to the recent releases of the plethora of 75% layout 
                        boards late last year in 2024, featuring the likes of the Neo75cu and TKD PT. 1/75.

                        <br>
                        Regardless of its amazing design, the first iteration of the Sonnet similarly to the Space65 R3 failed to meet 
                        my sound preference. Like the earlier Mode boards, I think the Sonnet (2022) is a bit thuddy and a fair bit too 
                        bassy for my liking.

                        The Mode Sonnet Refresh takes everything that I thought was lacking in its first iteration, and makes the perfect 
                        board atleast in my opinion. The Sonnet (2024) maintains its classic design, but introduces a new mounting style in the form 
                        of 3D printed lattice blocks. These latice blocks were first introduced in 
                        <a href="https://modedesigns.com/" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mode's</a> release of the Envoy in 2023, and 
                        these lattice blocks provide an interesting mounting style that fits my sound preference to a tee. With the full lattice 
                        blocks the Sonnet attained the ability to produce more "clacky" or higher pitched sounds. After its refresh, I think 
                        the Sonnet (2024) has become one of my favorite boards.
