                        I think the Transition Lite is a great entry board for its $55 price tag excluding tax, shipping, etc.
                        I wanted a board that I could kind of tinker with to take me back to my first custom build experience. 
                        Although it didn't really bring me the original joy and intrigue that got me into the hobby, 
                        it sounds and feels pretty decent as far as plastic boards go. 
                        I probably wouldn't recommend this to someone who is deep into the hobby, but for what it is, it's great.

                    <div class="entryParagraph">
                        The Space65 R3 is a board that a few may call their endgame. The design of the board is fairly pretty. 
                        From the inseem created between the top and bottom pieces to subtly display the mid accent piece, to the 
                        thicker side bezzels and magnetic accent badge. These design elements culminate in the bespoke board that 
                        is the Space65. However my only gripe with this interation of the Space65 is the sound. The flex cuts in the pcb 
                        and the mounting style of the board leaves a lot to be desired in terms of my own sound preference. 
                        WIth all that being said, I wouldn't consider the Space65 R3 to be an endgame board, but it sure is pretty.
